# Lazy Days Spa Server

### A server for the "Lazy Days Spa" app in the Udemy course "React Query: Server State Management for React"

## Installing

1. Run `npm install`
2. `cp .env_template .env`
3. Optional, only necessary if you're going to deploy: update `.env` to contain your own secret string (can just mash the key)

## Starting the server

### Important: This server uses the ts-node/esm loader, and _requires_ Node version 14+ It also does NOT work with 16.12.x+.

#### I am working on fixing the discrepencies with newer versions of Node and will update the repo soon.

Run `npm start`. The server will be found at [http://localhost:3030]
